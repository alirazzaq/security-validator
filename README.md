## Overview

This tool helps security professionals, developers, and penetration testers quickly confirm if a potential vulnerability is a **true positive** or a **false positive**. Unlike hardcoded scripts, this toolkit is built to work with any web application by accepting all necessary parameters—such as target URL, credentials, and headers—directly from the command line.

---

## Key Features ✨

* **Completely Generic:** No hardcoded URLs, credentials, or application-specific logic.
* **Modular Design:** Each vulnerability class has its own validator, making the tool easy to maintain and extend.
* **Multiple Vulnerability Classes:** Supports XSS, Open Redirect, SQL Injection, RCE/File Read, and SSRF.
* **Authentication Support:** Test endpoints protected by tokens or cookies using custom HTTP headers.
* **Flexible Output:** Choose between human-readable text or machine-readable JSON.
* **Supports GET & POST:** Validate vulnerabilities in both URL parameters and request bodies.
