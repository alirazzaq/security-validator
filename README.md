# Security Validator Toolkit

**Version: 1.0**
**Last Updated: September 26, 2025**

A generic and configurable Python-based toolkit designed to deterministically validate security findings. This tool helps security professionals, developers, and penetration testers quickly confirm if a potential vulnerability is a true positive or a false positive, saving time and effort in the vulnerability management lifecycle.

Unlike hardcoded scripts, this toolkit is built to work with any web application by accepting all necessary parameters‚Äîsuch as target URL, credentials, and headers‚Äîdirectly from the command line.

### Key Features

* **Completely Generic:** No hardcoded URLs, credentials, or application-specific logic.
* **Modular Design:** Each vulnerability class has its own validator, making the tool easy to maintain and extend.
* **Multiple Vulnerability Classes:** Supports validation for XSS, Open Redirect, SQL Injection, RCE/File Read, and SSRF.
* **Authentication Support:** Test endpoints protected by authentication using custom HTTP headers (e.g., Bearer tokens, cookies).
* **Flexible Output:** Choose between human-readable text or machine-readable JSON output.
* **Supports GET & POST:** Validate vulnerabilities in both URL parameters and request bodies.

Validator Details & Example Payloads
Below are detailed explanations and practical examples for each validator.

1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) üíâ
How It Works: Uses a headless Chrome browser to visit the target URL with the payload. It confirms a vulnerability if a JavaScript alert() box is triggered or if the non-encoded payload is reflected in the page's HTML source.

Theoretical Justification: A headless browser can execute JavaScript, making it highly effective for detecting not just reflected XSS but also DOM-based XSS. This method confirms that a browser would actually interpret and run the malicious script.

Example Payloads:
True Positive (Reflected XSS):

Bash

python validator.py --type xss --url "[http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=)" --payload "<script>alert('xss')</script>"
Expected Output: Result: True Positive, Reason: Alert popup detected.

True Positive (HTML Injection):

Bash

python validator.py --type xss --url "[http://testphp.vulnweb.com/search.php?test=query](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/search.php?test=query)" --payload "<h1>Injected</h1>"
Expected Output: Result: True Positive, Reason: Payload found in page source.

False Positive (Sanitized Input):

Bash

python validator.py --type xss --url "[https://google.com/search?q=](https://google.com/search?q=)" --payload "<script>alert('xss')</script>"
Expected Output: Result: False Positive, Reason: No alert popup and payload not in source.

2. Open Redirect ‚Ü™Ô∏è
How It Works: Sends a request with a payload pointing to an external domain. It inspects the Location response header to see if the server attempts to redirect the user to that external domain.

Theoretical Justification: This method directly checks the server's redirect instruction without following it, reliably confirming if the application can be abused to redirect users to malicious sites.

Example Payloads:
True Positive:

Bash

python validator.py --type open_redirect --url "[http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php?from=](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php?from=)" --payload "[https://www.google.com](https://www.google.com)"
Expected Output: Result: True Positive, Reason: Redirected to https://www.google.com

False Positive:

Bash

python validator.py --type open_redirect --url "[https://google.com/search?q=](https://google.com/search?q=)" --payload "[https://www.evil.com](https://www.evil.com)"
Expected Output: Result: False Positive, Reason: No redirect detected.

3. SQL Injection (SQLi) üíø
How It Works: Probes for vulnerabilities using two methods:

Error-Based: Appends a single quote (') and checks the response for common database error messages.

Time-Based: Injects a command to force the database to wait (e.g., WAITFOR DELAY) and measures if the server's response is delayed.

Theoretical Justification: Analyzing differential responses is a classic method for SQLi detection. Error messages are a direct leak of backend failure, while a time delay is strong evidence of a blind SQLi where the database is executing injected commands.

Example Payloads:
True Positive (Error-Based):

Bash

python validator.py --type sqli --url "[http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=)" --payload "1"
Expected Output: Result: True Positive, Reason: Error-based SQLi detected.

True Positive (Time-Based Blind SQLi for SQL Server):

Bash

python validator.py --type sqli --url "[http://vulnerable-app.com/items.aspx?id=](http://vulnerable-app.com/items.aspx?id=)" --payload "1; WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'--"
Expected Output: Result: True Positive, Reason: Time-based SQLi detected.

False Positive:

Bash

python validator.py --type sqli --url "[https://google.com/search?q=](https://google.com/search?q=)" --payload "1'"
Expected Output: Result: False Positive, Reason: No SQLi detected.

4. Remote Code Execution (RCE) / File Read üíª
How It Works: Injects payloads designed to run system commands (like id or whoami) or read common sensitive files (like /etc/passwd). It then checks the server's response for the expected output.

Theoretical Justification: This provides direct, undeniable proof of RCE by capturing the output of a command executed on the server, or confirms a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability by retrieving a system file's content.

Example Payloads:
True Positive (Command Injection - Linux):

Bash

python validator.py --type rce --url "[http://testphp.vulnweb.com/showimage.php?file=](http://testphp.vulnweb.com/showimage.php?file=)" --payload "| id"
Expected Output: Result: True Positive, Reason: RCE/File read detected. (if uid=... is in response)

True Positive (File Read - LFI):

Bash

python validator.py --type rce --url "[http://vulnerable-app.com/view.php?page=](http://vulnerable-app.com/view.php?page=)" --payload "/etc/passwd"
Expected Output: Result: True Positive, Reason: RCE/File read detected. (if root:x:0:0 is in response)

False Positive:

Bash

python validator.py --type rce --url "[https://google.com/search?q=](https://google.com/search?q=)" --payload "| id"
Expected Output: Result: False Positive, Reason: No RCE/File read detected.

5. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) üåê
How It Works: Injects a payload containing a URL that points to a known internal or metadata service (like localhost or 169.254.169.254). It checks the response for content characteristic of that internal service.

Theoretical Justification: If the application fetches and returns content from an internal-only IP address, it confirms the server can be used as a proxy to scan and attack internal network resources.

Example Payloads:
True Positive (Accessing localhost):

Bash

python validator.py --type ssrf --url "[https://vulnerable-app.com/proxy?url=](https://vulnerable-app.com/proxy?url=)" --payload "http://localhost/server-status"
Expected Output: Result: True Positive, Reason: SSRF detected. (if response contains "Apache Server Status")

True Positive (Cloud Metadata Endpoint):

Bash

python validator.py --type ssrf --url "[https://vulnerable-app.com/proxy?url=](https://vulnerable-app.com/proxy?url=)" --payload "[http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/](http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/)"
Expected Output: Result: True Positive, Reason: SSRF detected. (if response lists metadata like ami-id)

False Positive:

Bash

python validator.py --type ssrf --url "[https://google.com/](https://google.com/)" --payload "http://localhost"
Expected Output: Result: False Positive, Reason: No SSRF detected.

Advanced Usage
Testing with POST Requests
To test a parameter in a POST request body, use the --method POST and --data flags. Use the string PAYLOAD in the data argument where the payload should be injected.

Bash

python validator.py \
  --type xss \
  --method POST \
  --url "[https://vulnerable-app.com/comment](https://vulnerable-app.com/comment)" \
  --data "username=guest&comment=PAYLOAD" \
  --payload "<h1>XSS-TEST</h1>"
Testing Authenticated Endpoints
Use the --headers flag to provide authentication tokens, cookies, or any other required HTTP headers as a JSON string.

Bash

python validator.py \
  --type rce \
  --url "[https://api.internal-app.com/v1/tools?cmd=](https://api.internal-app.com/v1/tools?cmd=)" \
  --payload "whoami" \
  --headers '{"Authorization": "Bearer eyJhbGciOiJI...", "X-API-Version": "2"}'
